</strong></p><p><strong>Skateboarding is a popular form of recreation and sport among the youth. While it is considered an extreme form of activity, lots of young people are still attracted to it. Part of its popularity is perhaps due to its simplicity in that, you only need yourself and “the board” to ride in. Also, the skateboard itself is generally relatively cheaper than other sports equipment.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>It is said that skateboarding started between the late 1940s and the early 1950s in California. Surfers at that time thought of an alternative activity that can be as close to surfing during the season when the waves are flat. Thus, it was then originally called “sidewalk surfing”. You can imagine that even the design of the early boards itself was pretty much the shape of the iconic surfboard. Back then, it was nothing but a set of roller skates wheels attached to the board.  That means maneuverability and stirring are quite limited. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>During the 1960s, its popularity caught on that skateboard manufacturers started investing in the sport. The two major manufacturers at that time were Makaha and Hobie. In 1963, Makaha formed the first professional skateboard team which entered the first-ever professional skateboard competition held in that same year in Hermosa, California. This boosted skateboarding’s popularity significantly. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The popularity of skateboarding waned for some time due to the warnings of safety professionals about how dangerous it is due to its lack of maneuverability. Until in the mid-70s when further development was made to its design with the introduction of the “kicktail” that allowed the rider to do kick turns. Numerous developments and improvements were introduced to the skateboard over the years since.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In this period, safety was still a growing concern for safety professionals. The skateboard community itself was greatly affected. It was forced to go underground to ease the pressure. Thus, its popularity has waned once again. Despite this, it never lost its following. In fact, it went the other way around. And it is seemingly this fact that made it more popular among the youth. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The appeal of skateboarding cannot be denied among the youth. It became a popular avenue of expression for the young rebels who are still finding their place in society or the outliers who just wants to be left alone.   To most, riding the skateboard offers a “sense of freedom” and it brings out their creativity… in whatever form. It provides them with the opportunity to socialize and exchange thoughts and ideas with like-minded people. They are actually considered “outsiders” yet the community has grown so much that even the fashion industry has its own fashion line for skateboarders. They even have their own set of  “language” that identifies them among the rest. Thus, this community is considered a pop subculture.
